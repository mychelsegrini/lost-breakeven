## üéØ My Role: Team Lead & Game Developer

As the leader of an 8-person student development team, I was responsible for both the technical architecture and the successful execution of the project, delivering the final MVP within a 10-week timeframe.

### Key Contributions:

* **Project Architecture:** Designed the foundational structure of the game, including scene management, player state, and the main game loop, ensuring a scalable base for future development.
* **Core Gameplay Mechanics:** Personally architected and implemented key gameplay features using JavaScript and Phaser.js, including:
    * Player character movement and collision detection.
    * The NPC interaction system for delivering quests and financial tips.
    * The logic for triggering and completing in-game educational objectives.
* **Agile Project Management:** Led the team using the Scrum methodology. I organized sprints, managed the task backlog, and facilitated daily stand-ups to ensure we met our deadlines and delivered a high-quality product to our client, BTG Pactual.

Here is an illustrative snippet of the type of logic I was responsible for, handling player interaction with a quest-giving NPC:

```javascript
// Simplified example of player-NPC interaction logic
function onPlayerContact(player, npc) {
    // Check if the NPC has a quest and the player hasn't completed it
    if (npc.hasQuest && !player.quests.completed[npc.questId]) {
        // Stop player movement and trigger the dialogue UI
        player.body.stop();
        dialogueManager.startDialogue(npc.dialogueTree);
    }
}
